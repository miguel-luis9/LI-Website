<!-- we are hopefully on the main branch when we pull up the terminal, when git pages takes effect it will look at main branch. -->

<!-- Go to settings and click on pages, then we set the branch to main and this tells pages that we want to host that website/project for us -->
<!-- we want an html file to be the root/main -->


<!-- Because we made a new branch, we need to push not from main, but from styling(the branch name we gave it, not the file name) -->
<!-- We also have to pull it from the branch's push to combine styling with index.html -->
